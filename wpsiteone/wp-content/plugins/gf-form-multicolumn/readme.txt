This responsive-design plugin allows you to add multiple columns into your Gravity Forms form.  Once this plugin is installed, you can create columns by using three new buttons - Column Start, Column Break, and Column End.


== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress admin panel, go to <em>Plugins > New Plugin</em>, search for “Multi Column” for WordPress, find the “Gravity Forms Multi Column” plugin and click “<em>Install now</em>”.
2. Alternatively download the zip file, unzip, and upload the gf-form-multicolumn folder (and files) to your plugins directory, which usually is `/wp-content/plugins/`.
3. Activate the plugin through your <em>Plugins</em> area.
4. Create a new row of separated columns by selecting the Column Start button in the Multiple Columns Field box on the right-hand side of the Gravity Forms form page.
5. Add the fields that you want in the column.
6. Create a Column Break to separate to the next column, or Column End to end the column division and the field row.
7. Repeat 4-6 as necessary.
8. Click the Update button to save the changes.
