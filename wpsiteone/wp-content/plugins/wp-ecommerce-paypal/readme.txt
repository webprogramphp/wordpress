What makes this PayPal plugin powerful is its simplicity. You don't have to spend days setting up an eCommerce Solution. Just install this PayPal plugin and in just a few minutes customers from around the world can start buying products or services from your website using PayPal.

On the settings page of the plugin you will find clear instructions on how to sign up for a PayPal account if you don't have one already. This PayPal plugin also provides instructions for how to setup a PayPal Sandbox account - which will allow you to setup a fake PayPal buyer and seller account (with fake money) so you can test everything before you start selling to the public.
